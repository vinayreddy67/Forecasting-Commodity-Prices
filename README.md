# Forecasting-Commodity-Prices
        Forecasting commodity prices is a critical endeavor in financial markets and involves 
        predicting the future values ​​of major commodities. The complex dynamics of commodity markets, 
        influenced by geopolitical events, fluctuations in supply and demand, and macroeconomic trends, 
        underscore the importance of accurate forecasts. This process uses historical data, advanced 
        statistical models, and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and trends, helping investors, 
        companies, and decision-makers make informed decisions. The ability to predict commodity price movements 
        is essential because it shapes strategies, reduces risk, and contributes to the stability of the global economy.
# Overview
        This project aims to forecast commodity prices using linear regression and visualize the results for efficient decision-making in financial markets. The method combines historical commodity price data, linear regression modeling, and data visualization techniques to provide insight into potential future price changes.
# Getting Started
        Prerequisites

        Python 3.x

        Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

        Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
# Usage 
      1. Data Preparation
      
         Replace "commodity_data.csv" in the pseudocode with your dataset. Ensure that your dataset includes columns for date, commodity prices, and relevant 
         features influencing prices.
         
      2. Running the Forecasting Model
      
         Execute the forecasting script
            #python commodity_forecasting.py
         This script performs data preprocessing, splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains a linear regression model, makes predictions, and 
         evaluates the model's performance.

      3. Visualizing Results

         The script includes data visualization using Matplotlib. You can adjust the plotting parameters based on your dataset characteristics.

             #python commodity_forecasting.py
  # Results
      Forecast results and visualizations are displayed that give an idea of ​​the accuracy of the linear regression model and present forecasted commodity prices 
      against actual prices.
